# 🎮 GameQA — Question Answering on Gaming Texts with BERT

GameQA is a fine-tuned BERT-based Question Answering system trained to understand and extract answers from gaming-related documents and texts. Whether you're asking about a game’s release date or a character's background, GameQA finds the right answer directly from the content.
